## Background

Hello, my name is Alec Wall. Welcome to my personal project portfolio! A bit about me: I am an upperclass student at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science with an emphasis in computation. I started my undergraduate education interested in parallel computing and its effectiveness. Now, my interests have transitioned to the intersection of statistics and computation. I spend my time doing programming challenges and testing out different tools on Kaggle datasets.

In my free time, I am a keyboard enthusiast :)
