#Background 
Hello my name is Alec Wall, welcome to my personal project portfolio! A bit about me, I am a upperclass student at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science with an emphasis in computation. I started my undergraduate education interested in parallel computing and its effectiveness. And now my interests have transitioned me to the intersection of statistics and computation. I now spend my time doing programming challenges and testing out different tools on kaggle datasets. 

In my freetime I am a keyboard enthusiast :)
